# 🧠 Generative AI Supply Chain Risk Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Generative AI–powered supply chain decision support system** that predicts future risks such as **stock-outs and demand spikes** and explains them in **natural language with actionable recommendations**.

The system combines **time-series forecasting (Machine Learning)** with **Generative AI reasoning** to help businesses move from **reactive monitoring** to **proactive decision-making**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional supply chain systems detect problems **after losses occur**.  
While forecasting models predict demand, they do not explain:
- Why a risk exists
- What action should be taken
- When to act

### Solution
This project:
- Predicts future demand
- Detects upcoming supply chain risks
- Uses Generative AI to explain risks and suggest actions in plain English

## 🚀 Key Features
- 📈 Demand forecasting using time-series models (ARIMA / LSTM)
- 🚨 Automatic detection of stock-out and demand spike risks
- ✨ Generative AI explanations and recommendations
- 🖥️ Interactive dashboard using Streamlit
- 💬 Ask-the-AI interface for business questions
